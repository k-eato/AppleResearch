# Apple Detection and Classification
This project was developed to train a neural network to locate apples in images, as well as a second neural network to classify them between healthy and rotten apples. In order to do this, TensorFlow and its Object Detection API need to be installed and used. The following sections will walk through the various aspects of the project leading to the working solution. The goal is to demonstrate the work accomplished and also explain how to do it for those curious of working with the TensorFlow tools on a similar project.

### Dataset
Over the course of the project's work, three different datasets were collected/created. The first one captured consists of pictures of actual apples from an organic farm. These apples had lots of defects from brown spots to diseases, helping to gather images of rotten apples since that would be the harder of the two to find.
